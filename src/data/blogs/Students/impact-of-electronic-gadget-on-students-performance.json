As shown inFigure 1, students have smart devices for multiple purposes. Such are entertainment, studies, games, movies, online classes, and phone calls. The overall student spent an average of 7.4 hours on their electronic devices. The survey gave us information about the relationship between students\u2019 GPAs and the time allocation of their smart devices.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Among all the students, students with a 3.50 - 3.99 GPA do not use smart devices for gaming.. But more focus on educational purposes, which are studies and online classes.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">In addition, changes in the time allocation of smart devices may impact futureGPA. 0.37 percent of the student found an increase in GPA after eliminating gaming and movies from their smartphone uses. 0.27 percent of the student have a decrease in GPA and have a higher percentage of time allocated to gaming and movies than students with increasing GPA.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This survey suggests students who use smart devices primarily for educational purposes result in better academic performance.
