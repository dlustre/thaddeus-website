Since breakfast usually isn't the most filling meal for college students, it is important to include lots of protein in your lunch to keep you satisfied for the rest of the day. Avoid fast food so you don't feel groggy after your meal.\u202f\u202f </p><ol id=\"\"><li>Any pasta dish\u202f </li><li>Your favorite sandwich\u202f </li><li>Soup and Bread\u202f </li></ol><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">If you don't have time to go home or pack yourself a lunch, look for these options at the dining commons or on-campus restaurants\u2026\u202f </p><ol id=\"\"><li>Grilled\u202f </li><li>Broiled\u202f </li><li>Baked\u202f </li><li>Steamed\u202f </li><li>Roasted\u202f </li></ol><p id=\"\">Don't forget your fruits and veggies!\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Dinner</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Usually this is when students have the most time to cook a meal. If you can, try to prep your meals at the beginning of the week/over the weekend to make weeknight dinners as easy as possible.\u202f </p><ol id=\"\"><li>Chicken, Veggies, and Rice\u202f\u202f </li><li>Air-Fried Salmon\u202f\u202f </li><li>Fried Rice\u202f\u202f </li></ol><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">There are so many great resources online to help college students get into a schedule of cooking for themselves. Once you get into a routine, it becomes very easy to maintain a balanced diet as a college student. Hope this list helps and gave you some good ideas!
