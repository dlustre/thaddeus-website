    "Blog Intro": "While reading a book or having a discussion with an individual, you can go back and reread or ask a question to clarify a point. This is not always true when listening. Listening is of the moment, and we often only get to hear the speaker\u2019s words once. The key then is for the listener to ascertain the speaker\u2019s central premise or controlling idea quickly.",

Telling yourself the lecture is a waste of time is not going to help you to listen effectively. Approaching a listening task with a positive attitude to prevent making snap judgements that justify inattentiveness.\u202f\u202f <br>\u200d<strong id=\"\">Example \u2013\u202f</strong>decide where you stand on a topic after listening, be ready and willing to be patient and see where to speaker is leading you, refrain from speaking until after you gauge the overall idea\u202f\u202f \u202f <br><br>\u200d<strong id=\"\">Adjustment -\u202f</strong>Adjustment means that the listener is willing to change, adapt, and adjust mannerisms in order to follow the speaker\u2019s train of thought until the conclusion.\u202fThe speaker relies on the audience to provide visual cues to know that the audience is listening and that there is a shared understanding of what is being presented. It is the listeners role to provide these cues in order to show active listening feedback.\u202f <br>\u200d<strong id=\"\">Example -\u202f</strong>\u202freact to the cues the speaker gives by showing expressions, adjust your focus on the speaker through an upright position and eye contact\u202f\u202f \u202f <br><br>The process of actively listening assists people with strengthening intimate relationships, you are showing them that they are important and worthy of attention. This goes a long way toward sustaining a positive relationship, yet there are many barriers deter us from actively listening, these include:\u202f\u202f \u202f <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong id=\"\">Anticipating-</strong> formulating what you want to say before the speaker finishes their statement, you shouldn't assume the speakers conclusion halfway through their statement and configure your own response. <em id=\"\">Instead, refrain from speaking until the speaker has finished and instead focus on what the speaker is trying to claim</em>\u202f <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong id=\"\">Judging-\u202f</strong>Once a judgement has been made, listening is lessened, you may stop listening actively because the speaker lost credibility by making a mistake, you are making a choice to stop listening and rate the speaker poorly.\u202f <em id=\"\">Instead, accept the fact that people make mistakes and that doesn't make them incompetent, give them a chance to repair their credibility\u202f</em>\u202f <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong id=\"\"> Emotional Reactions- </strong>Sometimes, triggers may act as a listening barrier and overbear emotions which could end an argument due to an inability to have thoughtful communication. <em id=\"\">Instead, acknowledge your emotional triggers and set them aside to hear out the speaker, take into account everyone has triggers and don\u2019t let them transfer into judgement\u202f</em>\u202f \u202f <br><br>When active listening, there are many techniques you can utilize that show the speaker that you are attentive and giving your attention, a few examples are to: establish rapport, demonstrate concern, paraphrase, maintain eye contact, nod/ lean in forward, and give brief affirmations such as \"I understand\" or \"I know.\"\u202f <br></p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\"><br></em><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">References:</em></strong><em id=\"\"><br>Learning, L.
