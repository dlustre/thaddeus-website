    "Blog Intro": "Every student has so much potential to excel in school. But learning in a classroom isn't for everyone, and many students fall behind as a result. It's not because the students aren't smart or incapable of understanding what's being taught in the classroom, but a question of how the material is being presented.",

It's not because the students aren't smart or incapable of understanding what's being taught in the classroom, but a question of how the material is being presented. </p><p id=\"\"> </p><p id=\"\">There are four main learning styles that can improve how students can learn: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and reading/writing. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"> </p><p id=\"\">For visual learners, create images that better organize the information that needs to be retained, whether through graphs, infographics, or diagrams. If students are taking notes, making the notes filled with more imagery will allow the students to connect concepts to visuals that will be easier to understand. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"> </p><p id=\"\">For auditory learners, when there is heavy reading assigned, read the material out loud. Not only will the information be seen while reading the words, but students can listen to the words that they are reading out. During an online class or meeting setting, use headphones to tune out external sounds that may distract students from retaining the information. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"> </p><p id=\"\">For kinesthetic learners, fidget toys are helpful in allowing students to stay engaged. If possible, perform hands-on experiments that will allow students to connect concepts to something they can touch. For example, perform the coin experiment with water drops to demonstrate properties of water or go to a zoo or museum to learn more about topics that students are learning in the classroom. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"> </p><p id=\"\">Last but not least, reading/writing learners should take notes during class. Listening to the teacher alone is usually not engaging enough for students to retain information for longer periods of time, so taking notes no matter what type of learner you are is always a good idea. Rewriting notes and reviewing textbooks for further understanding can be helpful as well. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"> </p><p id=\"\">Although it is not accurate that each student has a specific learning style, it is important to engage new concepts through many sensory pathways. The more diverse ways students are exposed to a topic, the better they will be able to connect what they learn with the real world! </p><p>\u200d</p>",
