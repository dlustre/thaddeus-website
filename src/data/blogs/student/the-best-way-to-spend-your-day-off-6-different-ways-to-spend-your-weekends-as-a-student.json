The weekend comes as a perfect time for you to relax, refresh, meditate, go around, get prepared, and plan certain things for next week. This article will tell you all the best ways to spend your weekends as a student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">1. Take a Good Sleep&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Throughout the week, your body is active. You\u2019re attending your lectures, working on assignments, participating in group studies\u2026the list goes on. You\u2019ve used a lot of physical energy to complete all of these tasks. The weekend is a good opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.mottchildren.org/health-library/uz2209\" id=\"\">relax your body</a>. Sleep a bit longer than normal to allow your body and mind to unwind. Getting enough sleep over the weekend will recharge your batteries and prepare you for the next weekdays.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep include:&nbsp;</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Improved grades&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Better memory&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Lower risk of obesity&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Decreased chances of getting sick&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Improved mood&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">2. Embark On A Nature Walk&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Once you are sufficiently rested, consider spending some time with nature. Spending time in the woods can be very therapeutic as it offers you time away from technology. Moreover, it is relaxing and rejuvenating for the mind. Take a breath of fresh air and let your lungs enjoy it too. You can ask your colleagues to join you on a <a href=\"https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/one-day-hikes-uk\" id=\"\">quick nature walk</a>. This will help you build rapport with them and thereby, allow you to have a pleasant university experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">3. Explore Your Local Area&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">As an international student in a whole new country, you\u2019ll be tempted to check out your local area. The weekend is the perfect time for you to do this! One of the best student activities you can do is just wander around the old streets and alleyways <a href=\"https://uniacco.com/blog/best-student-cities-in-united-kingdom\" id=\"\">near your UK university</a>. If you\u2019re into being active and getting out of your room, simply going for a walk is an excellent way to learn more about your local area, find interesting places to visit and even discover little pockets of town that you\u2019ve never come across before.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">4. Catch Up With Studies&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">As much as you want to simply unwind and relax during the weekend, your studies cannot completely take the back seat. The most important activity you have as a student is to do well academically. Student life can be fun and relaxing, but don\u2019t we all have times when there\u2019s one more essay to rush, or an important deadline to make? Sounds relatable, right?&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The quieter moments of the weekend can be a good chance to really digest what you\u2019ve learned. Start preparing for the next part of the course, and also, do that extra reading you keep meaning to get round to!&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">5. Earn Some Money&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Pursuing higher education abroad does not come cheap. You might have dipped into your savings or secured an <a href=\"https://unicreds.com/uk\" id=\"\">education loan to the UK</a> to fund your education. If you\u2019ve chosen the latter then you probably know that your loan needs to be repaid with interest. Use the weekends to secure a <a href=\"https://uniacco.com/blog/part-time-job\" id=\"\">part-time job</a>, either within the university or elsewhere, so that you earn some extra cash to pay off your student debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You can opt to work at your university\u2019s administrative department, or if you are good at IT, you can contribute to the university\u2019s technical support network. Obviously, make sure you don\u2019t take on too much, but this experience can be a good way of earning some extra money and also gaining useful experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">6. Focus On Your Health&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">I can\u2019t emphasize enough how important it is to obtain proper sleep and exercise during your university years. Being a \u2018weekend warrior\u2019 may be the norm in university, but any exercise is preferable to none \u2013 especially if you have a busy schedule from Monday to Friday. Make use of the weekend to spend some time <a href=\"https://uniacco.com/blog/best-healthy-student-meals\" id=\"\">cooking healthy, nutritious food</a>. Consider making a large batch and stocking up your fridge and freezer, so that you\u2019re never out of fuel for the long study sessions ahead in the weekdays.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Picture:&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://cdn.uniacco.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/04105038/sleep.jpg\" id=\"\">sleep.jpg</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://cdn.uniacco.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/04105142/health.jpg\" id=\"\">health.jpg</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">References&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Linhares, K., &amp; Khambati, A.
