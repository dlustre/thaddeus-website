It is important to address this question in order to prepare students for a fulfilling school year. </p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p><p id=\"\">First, what does being successful in school mean? The easiest and most common answer is good grades. Students can strive for good grades by attending school every day, listening to the teacher, completing class assignments, working with other students, and asking questions when they don\u2019t understand something. Outside of the classroom, students should complete their homework to the best of their ability and in a timely manner. Students can further their language skills by going to the library and reading books. Students can meet with their classmates and discuss topics from class that they did not understand. However, it is important to stress that getting good grades should not be the only or the most important goal for students. Other factors, such as building friendships and maintaining physical and mental health are also important for student success. </p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p><p id=\"\">The first week of school is a great time for students to reconnect with old classmates and make new friends. Being kind, friendly, helpful, and accepting can help students make friends easier. If there is a new student in the class, it is important to welcome them into existing friend groups and make sure they feel at ease. If you are a new student, do not be afraid to introduce yourself to others and explore your new environment. You might feel anxious about not fitting in, but eventually you will. </p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p><p id=\"\">Besides getting good grades and establishing good relationships, student success involves maintaining good physical and mental health. Schools often have a physical education class, where students can take a break from classes and participate in sports and other activities. However, just having this class is not enough. Students can look for other ways to be active, such as club sports, running, biking, swimming, skateboarding, playing tennis etc. during their free time. Good quality sleep is important to both physical and mental health. Students should set a consistent sleep schedule, around 9 hours per night. Both physical activity and sleep are also critical for mental health. Students can maintain their mental health by talking to someone they trust, particularly an adult, if they feel negative emotions or are facing challenges.</p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p><p id=\"\">Student success involves a variety of factors, including achieving good grades, building friendships, and maintaining physical and mental health. Of course, this list is not extensive since student success involves many other factors as well. Thank you for reading and hope you have a wonderful school year filled with success! :) </p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Photo credits: https://www.insightassessment.com/article/admissions-retention-and-licensure</p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p><p id=\"\">About the Author:</p><p id=\"\">Sophie is a psychology intern at Thaddeus.
