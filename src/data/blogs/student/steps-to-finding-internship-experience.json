    "Blog Content": "<p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Determine your interests</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">The first step to any internship or job search is to figure out your incentive, or the \"why.\" Why do you want to find an internship? Here are some starting questions to ask yourself:\u202f </p><ul id=\"\"><li>What is my major? What career field do I want more experience in?\u202f </li><li>How much time am I willing to commit to an internship?\u202f </li><li>For what period of time do I want an internship? Do I want a part-time or summer internship?\u202f </li><li>Am I looking for virtual or in-person opportunities?\u202f </li><li>What skills do I want to add to my resume?\u202f </li></ul><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Asking yourself these questions before you begin will streamline your search on online internship websites. Writing these questions down will also help you later on when filling out applications or preparing for interviews.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">2. Know Where to Look</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">The key to finding internships is knowing where to look.\u202f</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" src=\"https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Online Internship Search Sites</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">LinkedIn and Handshake are great places to start! Handshake is specifically designed for college students, while LinkedIn is a more general social networking site for finding internship opportunities. Each site allows you to customize your profile to provide you with programs\u202f\u202f </p><p id=\"\">specific to your interests.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">However, don't stop your search there.</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Using lesser-known internship sites increases the chances of getting hired because there is less competition. Here are some other internship sites to search through:\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><ul id=\"\"><li>Indeed.com\u202f </li><li>CA Intern Network\u202f </li><li>Chegg Inc (Internships.com)\u202f </li><li>InternQueen.com\u202f </li><li>WayUp.com\u202f </li></ul><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Don't pass up a quick Google Search either!\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Ex: \"Internships for in my area\" or \"Internships in [Location]\"\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Ask Around</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">One of the best ways to find jobs or internships is through personal connections, aka your network.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">If you are in any student organizations or clubs, ask other members how they found internships. Ask your professors or TA's if they know of any ongoing research opportunities. Speak to family members, friends, roommates, anyone you know!\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">You can also send a personal email to a company you are interested in working with. Connect with someone on LinkedIn holding a position you are interested in. There are plenty of resources and people that are willing to help you!\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">You will be surprised by how effective simply asking is at finding an internship.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Visit Your University Career Center</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Career centers are also a great place to find internships. Set up an appointment with an advisor at your university's career center or visit their website.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">If you go to a university, chances are your school's career center holds career fairs as well. Take advantage of these! Career fairs are a great way to find internships because you speak directly with current employees and recruiters. Introducing yourself and following up with an employer is a much more personal way of getting hired.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3. Build Your Profile</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Now that you know what you want, it is time to build your profile. Make a master document of all your past work, leadership, or volunteer experience, including the title, location, duration, and description of your position\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Note: Any experience counts! Most recruiters do NOT expect college interns to have extensive experience. They are looking for interns that are excited about their program and willing to learn.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Now that you have organized your experience, update your resume and create your cover letter. Be sure to upload your updated resume and cover letter onto your LinkedIn and Handshake account. When building your online account, include a profile picture and a brief description of who you are, where you are located, your education level, and what you plan to do in the future.\u202f </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" src=\"https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">For Handshake users, update your settings to \"community\" to allow employers to view your profile and contact you directly!\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Consistently updating your online profile will signal to employers that you are actively looking for a program and will give employers a better idea of what kind of intern you may be. Include your contact information on your account as well, such as your email address and Linkedin URL, for recruiters to reach out to you.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4. Find Internships that Fit You</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Finally, it is time to start looking for internships. Your LinkedIn and Handshake page will provide you with personalized internship programs catered to your account. Look through this curated list and save any that fit your profile you made for yourself from Step 1.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">If any of your connections from Step 3 put you into contact with an employer, email them directly asking about the internship to figure out if it is a good fit for you.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Tip: Write down the application deadlines for the internships you like. You do not want to make the mistake of forgetting a deadline!\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Pick a few internships to focus on. Organize their requirements and applications into a Google Spreadsheet or Document to easily visualize what deadlines you must meet to turn in the application on time. Organization is key!\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5. Set Aside Time to Apply</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" src=\"https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Now that you have a layout of which internship programs you want to apply for, set aside ample time to fill out the applications thoroughly. When filling out applications, it is best to stay concise and let your personality show through your writing.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">If you get called in for an interview, study the company you are interviewing under. Do they have an office? What kind of workplace is it? How many positions are available? What kind of candidates apply here? Create a list of questions to ask the interviewer.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Take each interview and application one step at a time. Create a realistic schedule for yourself and stick to it.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Conclusion</strong>\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Everyone knows an internship is vital to gain real-life experience in the field, but the pressures and stresses of a pandemic can make internships seem impossible. However, like any significant opportunity, it helps to break it down into steps.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">Follow this plan, stay organized, and stick to a schedule. You will be rejected, but do not let that discourage you. Persistence is key for landing any job opportunity.\u202f </p><p id=\"\">\u202f </p><p id=\"\">My final piece of advice is to forgive yourself if you find yourself procrastinating or falling away from your original plan. The mere fact that you are even looking for an internship is something to be proud of. When one door closes, another one opens. Everything will work out in the end and remember to trust yourself!\u202f </p>",
